# PlatocosmGL
My personal hobby project where I try to simulate a galaxy with SDL and OpenGL in C++.

It's in its very early stages and used primarily for me to learn OpenGL and SDL.

Should work by simply opening the project solution in visual studio 2022 and compiling and running the main function.
